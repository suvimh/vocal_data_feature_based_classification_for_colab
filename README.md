Notebooks and functions used to try various classification tasks on processed multimodal vocal data.

These notebooks are structures so that they can be run in Google Colab given that the necessary folder structure is in Google Drive.

1. Running the code:
   Follow the step by step process outlines in the python notebooks. If interested in the internal workings of the
   functions used, look at the other python scripts containing them.

2. Data
   It is recommended that you work with the data within the data folder. Do not commit your data csvs. If you rename them from the naming conventioned used by the repo, add them to the gitignore file.
